It is considered a traffic violation to ride a two-wheeler on Indian roads without valid insurance. However, it is not mandatory to insure the bike with comprehensive insurance, but it financially protects you in case of damage or loss to your two-wheeler. To reduce any financial implications due to damages or losses to your vehicle, insuring your vehicle with comprehensive coverage will avoid unnecessary expenses.`,

The former is mandatory by Indian law, however, more coverages and benefits are offered by the latter. If you wish to avail minimum coverage i.e. only against third-party liabilities, opt for third-party car insurance. However, if you want to protect your car as well, go for a Comprehensive policy.`,
